# Mood Tracking Feature

## Overview
The mood tracking feature allows users to record their emotional state when they're interrupted from social media apps, helping them understand their mood patterns and emotional wellbeing over time.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. When a user attempts to open a social media app, they are redirected to the wellbeing break screen
2. They can select "Track Mood" from the available activities
3. This takes them to a dedicated mood tracking screen with the interrupted app context

### Mood Tracking Screen Features

#### Mood Selection
- Six mood options: Happy üòä, Sad üò¢, Content üòå, Bored üòê, Anxious üò∞, Neutral üòê
- Visual grid layout with emojis and color-coded borders
- Interactive selection with visual feedback

#### Reasoning Input
- Multi-line text input for users to explain their mood
- Required field to encourage thoughtful reflection
- Placeholder text to guide user input

#### Context Awareness
- Shows which app was interrupted (e.g., "You were about to open: Instagram")
- Provides context for why the user might be feeling a certain way

#### Data Storage
- Saves entries to AsyncStorage with timestamps
- Stores mood, reasoning, interrupted app, and timestamp
- Entries persist between app sessions

#### Recent Entries Display
- Shows the 5 most recent mood entries
- Displays mood emoji, label, timestamp, reasoning, and interrupted app
- Helps users track their emotional patterns over time
